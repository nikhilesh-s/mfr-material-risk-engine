At start of heat flux exposure the sample corners lifted and curled towards the center. The sample continued to warp, then relaxed as the material started melting. The sample remained as a partially melted mass with less than half of the original exposed surfaced area. Ignition began as a candle sized flame which slowly spread across the sample surface. The time to ignition event was recorded when flames had spread across the majority of the sample area, more than a minute after the initial ignition.

# MFR Risk Model

This project estimates the fire failure risk and resistance of materials
(polymers, composites, and generic materials) under defined thermal exposure
conditions using a simplified ML-based framework.

## MVP Objective
Given material type and fire exposure parameters, output:
- Numerical risk score (0–100)
- Categorical risk class (Low / Medium / High)
- Resistance index (relative scale)

This repository contains the Phase 0–1 model logic and prototype.
